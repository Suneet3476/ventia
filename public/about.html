        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Ventia was born out of a pressing need for mental health services that respect privacy and accessibility. With growing challenges in today's world—be it career stress, relationships, or the weight of expectations—many find themselves struggling in silence. We wanted to change that by creating a safe space where anyone can express their feelings without fear of judgment.
